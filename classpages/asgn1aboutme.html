	 				<h3>This will be where you can find out about me. Where I come from, and where I'm goin with this.</h3>
	 					<p>My name is Fyne Loveday. Nice to meet you. This website is currently under constant growth, as I am just starting, and there is not much content to show you right now. Feel free to make a frequent stop here as I will hit the ground running with activity, which means the content of this site will increase very rapidly.</p>
	 					<p>Just to let you know, other than a few dabbles here and there, I have not had much experience with software development. So please bear with me as I continue to learn.</p>
	 					<p><h3>Origin</h3></p>
	 					<p>As mentioned before, I have dabbled in software design before. A class in Computer Information Systems, and some personal tutorial here and there. This is my first full time dive into the field.</p></div>
